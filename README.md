# icinga-templates
This is a mechanism for auto-generating an icinga/nagios config from your own existing database entries. (Hosts, services, contacts, contact groups or any subset)

We use it to auto-generate a monolithic icinga config file from a few SQL queries and some template files.


This is by no means completed or distribution ready, its just an internal tool I wanted to share. It could be developed into a configurable useful generic tool if people are interested in helping to do that.

In the mean time, its just here for reference.
